Changes in 1.2
-------------------------------
scale - updated so it can be a value (eg Image.scale(0.5))
binarize - now defaults to Otsu's method rather than binarize 127
blit - overlay images on top of other images with the blit function
start/stop camera - You now have the ability to start and stop a camera object without restarting simplecv
randomized color - set each feature to support auto coloring
stretch filter fixed
foreground/background (codebook) segmentation - Easily compute the difference between foreground and background
use web based flash to acquire images in webpage
bag of features - This is used to detect features and use those features in image classification
shape detectors - Added functions like isCircle(), isSquare(), etc.
better camera support - Now supports HD and fallbacks so if openCV isn't working it tries other methods to work with camera
python imaging library is now required
hue distance - get the distance in hue from current image to another
template matching - This is basic pattern matching
convolution added
integral image - take the derivative of an image
haar wavelet calculations
SVM (binary/multiclass) support added using OrangeSVM
naive bayes (binary/multiclass) support added
decision learning tree (binary/multiclass) support added
random forrest machine learning added
optical character recognition (OCR) support added via Tesseract
ability to load images from URL. i.e. img = Image("http://www.foo.com/bar.png")
pass a feature to crop function
KNN classifier
image segmentation
